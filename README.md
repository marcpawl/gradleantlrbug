# gradleantlrbug
Demonstrate bug with gradle not failing on antlr when "-lib" argument is used in gradle.

run.sh will setup a Docker instance and run the tests demonstrating the problem.

If you do not want to use Docker, then you can use code/bug.sh which you may have to tweak to get the paths correct.
